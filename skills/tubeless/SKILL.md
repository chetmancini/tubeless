# Author Tubeless pipelines

Use the project's installed Tubeless version and public package imports. Keep
domain logic in ordinary functions and make orchestration explicit in the graph.

## Find the matching documentation

Read the consumer's package manifest, installed Tubeless version, and existing
pipeline conventions first. The installed `tubeless` package includes `docs/`
and `examples/`; locate it through the project's package manager. Within the
Tubeless source repository, use those directories at the repository root.

Read `docs/agent-guide.md`, then the smallest matching example in
`docs/recipes.md`. These paths are relative to the **Tubeless package**, not
this installed skill or the consumer's repository. If package docs are absent,
start with the [public documentation index](https://tubeless.io/llms.txt),
[agent guide](https://tubeless.io/docs/agent-guide.md), and
[recipes](https://tubeless.io/docs/recipes.md). Confirm newer examples against
the installed declarations before using them; do not silently upgrade Tubeless.

## Authoring decisions

- Use `createSteps<TDomainOptions>()` per pipeline and destructure every
  constructor it needs: `step`, `fromPipeline`, `fromRemote`, `iteratePipeline`, and/or
  `forEachPipeline`. Domain options contain business inputs; pass built-in
  controls separately to `run(options, controls?)`.
  Use `run()` or `runOrThrow()` when all input fields are optional; omitted input
  becomes a fresh `{}` and still undergoes schema validation. Supply controls with
  `run(undefined, controls)` in that case.
- Use `plan(controls)` to validate static controls and selection without invoking
  domain schemas or handlers. Runs reuse the same control validation.
- Opt in to independent DAG parallelism with `run(options, { maxConcurrency: 4 })`;
  the default is `1`. All dependency edge types wait for terminal prerequisites.
  Declare edges for side-effect ordering; child runs have their own concurrency limit.
  Fail-fast stops dispatch without cancelling active work. External cancellation
  stops dispatch in either error mode and drains active work. Final reports and
  step errors use plan order; hooks and traces use event order.
- For repeated steps known before execution, adapt the recipe-local helper in
  `examples/parameterized-steps.ts`. Use explicit IDs and source step references,
  expand synchronously, then spread the tuple into the ordinary pipeline. Preserve
  each literal ID and the shared output type; do not generalize its tuple assertion
  to factories with varying output types. Use `forEachPipeline` for runtime items.
- Give steps stable kebab-case IDs and descriptions of their domain work.
  `name` is an optional display label. Return values from steps and consume
  inferred dependency outputs instead of sharing mutable state.
- Use `metadata: { tags, owner, domain, annotations }` for descriptive discovery.
  `querySteps(plan, query)` and `toMermaid({ query })` filter displayed steps only;
  use targets for execution. Metadata is bounded JSON, snapshotted at compilation,
  never inherited, and recorded in identity version 3. Document v1 does not accept
  step or pipeline metadata. Read `docs/graph-metadata.md` and `examples/graph-metadata.ts`.
- Give a pipeline optional `name` and `description` when CLI and Studio need
  presentation beyond its stable ID. Pipeline commands inherit both fields;
  command-level values are overrides for adapter-specific help.
- Use `dependsOn` for required outputs, `optionalDependsOn` for expected
  absence, and `skipAfterFailureOf` for a failure gate without a required value.
  Keep publication dependent on successful validation.
- Add `skip` to a step definition for an intentional successful omission. A
  string or `{ reason }` result produces `T | undefined`; handle that absence
  explicitly. If every skip branch returns `{ reason, value }`, the output
  remains `T`. Do not turn exceptions into skips.
- Set `dryRun: "skip"` on writes and other external side effects, or supply a
  side-effect-free typed preview handler. Unmarked steps still run in dry runs.
- A `definePipeline` can be `{ id, steps }`: unfiltered runs select every step.
  Explicit run `targets` select only those goals and their required prerequisites.
  Omitted definition `targets` exposes the last step in execution order as a
  selectable goal; it is never selected automatically. Use `targets: []` to expose
  none. Omitted `finalize` returns that last step's output, or `undefined` if absent.
- Use `finalize: step` to require and return one declared step's exact output type.
  Missing outputs fail finalization; a published `undefined` remains valid.
  Targets and selection remain independent. `resultSchema` can validate or transform
  the selected output. See `examples/precise-result.ts`.
- Use `requireOutputs` when the final result requires specific outputs. A plain
  finalizer is appropriate when partial results are valid domain results.
- Use `runOrThrow` for callers expecting a successful value, `run` for callers
  inspecting structured failures or partial results, and `plan(controls)` when
  no work should execute. Branch on `run.finalized` to narrow `run.value` to the
  exact result type; finalization is independent of success, and a finalized
  result may itself be `undefined`. Plans do not validate domain input.
- Opt deterministic ordinary steps into `cache: { version: "v1" }`, or use
  `cache: true` with a pipeline `implementationVersion`. Default keys hash inputs
  and validated options; files live under the run cwd's `.cache/<pipeline>/<step>/`.
  Set pipeline `cache.maxAge: "30 days"`, with optional step overrides. Custom keys,
  stores, and codecs are optional. Run `{ cache: "recompute" }` or `--cache recompute`
  refreshes opted-in steps and children. Dry runs, skips, and overrides bypass cache.
  Cache writes and validated hits record cache artifacts automatically; hits do not
  replay application artifact records or verify referenced files. The default codec
  rejects lossy round trips, including class instances; use plain data or a custom
  codec that reconstructs them. Artifact helpers reject cache configuration.
  Read `docs/step-output-cache.md` and adapt `examples/step-output-cache.ts`.
- Use `context.log`, forward `context.signal`, use `context.sleep` for waits,
  and report progress for long loops. Resolve relative paths from `context.cwd`.
- Branch on structured error `code`, `phase`, and `kind`, not message text.
- Group application pipelines with `defineProject(id, [pipelineA, pipelineB])` from
  `tubeless/project`. Retrieve one with `project.get(id)`; it keeps the exact pipeline
  option and result types and uses the pipeline's existing methods directly.
  Register each pipeline exactly once, directly or through its command, for example
  `[pipelineA, commandB]`. Duplicate IDs fail regardless of entry form. Children are
  not registered recursively. The project views are derived immutable snapshots.
  Let `definePipeline` infer its generics; annotate the finalizer's return type
  for an explicit result contract. Partial explicit generics widen the pipeline ID
  to `string`, so project lookup no longer checks literal IDs at compile time.
  Use `PipelineInput<typeof pipeline>` and `PipelineResult<typeof pipeline>` for
  wrapper contracts; the input is the value accepted by `run` before schema
  transformation. `definePipelineCommand` retains the exact pipeline on
  `command.pipeline`.
  Optional `{ name, description }` in the third argument supplies project
  presentation; the name defaults to the ID. For compiled documents, reuse
  `compiled.metadata?.name` and `compiled.metadata?.description`, or spread
  `compiled.metadata` before explicit overrides. Authors/date remain descriptive;
  the project ID and execution cwd belong to registration.

## Add only the capabilities the workflow needs

Read the corresponding package recipe before using these features:

- `defineModelAgent({ id, model })` from `tubeless/agent` for a ready-to-run
  workspace agent. `openaiModel()` from `tubeless/agent/openai` supplies the optional
  Responses adapter; `anthropicModel()` from `tubeless/agent/anthropic` supplies the
  Messages adapter with the same option names (`model`, `apiKey`, `baseUrl`,
  `reasoningEffort`, `compactAfterBytes`, `timeoutMs`). Set `baseUrl` (or
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) for any compatible server, and
  `compactAfterBytes: null` when it lacks compaction. Most Anthropic-compatible
  servers need `authToken` (bearer), `strict: false`, and `promptCaching: false`; see
  `docs/agents.md#compatible-apis`.
  Reasoning settings are omitted unless explicitly configured;
  the coding recipe opts into `reasoningEffort: "high"` for a supported model.
  Run with `{ task }` to get `{ answer }`; add `instructions`,
  tools or execution limits as needed. The factory loads startup AGENTS.md guidance
  from the physical workspace path, shared by the model and every tool call,
  and owns isolated conversation state. The adapter preserves native history and
  compacts completed turns. Read project guidance in a separate turn before the
  work it governs; optional exploration follows it. Custom OpenAI tool descriptors
  must be inline; provide
  `inputJsonSchema` when generated descriptors contain references. All object
  properties must be required, with `additionalProperties: false` at every object.
  Anthropic strict tools allow optional properties but cap a request at 20 strict
  tools; set `strict: false` for larger registries.
  Large output batches use explicit model-visible previews; harness outcomes remain
  complete. Read `docs/agents.md`, `examples/agent-model.ts`, and
  `examples/agent-model-anthropic.ts` for
  context-loading scope, byte bounds and live-evaluation instructions. Custom
  `defineAgent` and `decide` remain the lower-level path.

- `defineAgent`, `defineTool`, and `pipelineTool` from `tubeless/agent` for bounded in-process
  decisions over registered handlers, pipelines, and subagents. Read `docs/agents.md` and
  `examples/agent.ts`; use `examples/agent-openai.ts` for a real Responses API
  callback with native fetch. Keep provider calls application-owned, validate raw
  decisions and all schema boundaries, and reduce ordered outcomes into owned
  plain-data state. Handler-originated `ToolError` is recoverable; validation and
  unclassified failures are fatal. Dry-run decisions and tools need explicit
  previews. Use `examples/agent-delegation.ts` for child agents and ordinary
  pipeline tools. Reuse the child options schema, or supply `inputSchema` and
  `mapOptions` together. Use `examples/agent-pipeline.ts` to embed an agent with
  `fromPipeline` and consume its validated answer in an ordinary dependent step.
  Keep mapping free of side effects. The complete batch
  is prevalidated and transforms run once. Calls, decisions, depth, and leaf
  concurrency obey shared ancestor limits; turns are local. Waiting wrappers
  hold no leaf permit. Ordinary child composition carries the private scope.
  Record with `--trace` or `--store`; `tubeless history <run-id>` joins agent turns,
  calls and child agents with state versions, failures and termination. JSON
  details expose `agentHistory.agents`; missing observations remain unknown.
  Add `durability: { store, key }` with an explicit `implementationVersion` to
  persist decisions, call outcomes, child state and ancestor budgets. Every live
  child inheriting recovery also needs `implementationVersion`; bump it when
  changing its semantics. Resume
  using unchanged inputs, workspace and semantics. Running unsafe calls produce
  recoverable interruption outcomes; `replay: "safe"` is only for repeatable or
  idempotent work. Keep initialization, mapping, validators and reducers pure.
  Read `docs/agents.md` and `examples/agent-durable.ts` for SQLite acknowledgement
  and single-host ownership. Supply `environment` for remote workspace guidance,
  files and commands; children inherit it. The local adapter's default authority
  id is host-independent, so recreated containers resume; pass `id` to name a
  distinct authority. Custom tools should use
  `context.environment` and `context.execution` for workspace authority and
  durable business idempotency. Node adapters live in `tubeless/agent/node`;
  see `examples/agent-environment.ts` for the workspace adapter.
  Every agent includes `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `list`, and `search`.
  Custom `tools` extend the registry or replace built-ins by name. Reducers must
  narrow outcomes by `ok` and `tool`. Paths use the run cwd and host permissions;
  dependent file operations belong in successive turns. Read/list/search work in
  dry runs; write/edit/bash skip live execution. See `examples/agent-workspace.ts`
  and the bounds documented in `docs/agents.md`.
  Read provider credentials inside `decide`, forward cancellation, and test the
  HTTP boundary with fixtures. The OpenAI recipe has no preview decision source;
  its dry run skips model work and has no final answer. Provider schemas and
  response mapping belong in application code, not the runtime.
  Bound model input and accumulated observations. The OpenAI recipe rejects
  oversized questions, history, and encoded requests locally, preserving exact
  tool results within those budgets.

- For YAML or JSON authoring, read `docs/declarative-pipelines.md` and
  `examples/yaml-pipelines.ts`. Use `compilePipelineDocument(document, registry)` from
  `tubeless/project` on parsed data with explicitly registered handlers,
  adapters, skip predicates, and schemas. Each document step declares `run`,
  `fromPipeline`, or `forEachPipeline`; composed pipeline IDs resolve inside
  the document and use the matching adapter registry for application-owned
  option, item, and result mapping. Keep parsing at the application edge. The immutable
  compiled value exposes `pipelines`, throwing `get(id)`, and validated metadata.
  Use a selected pipeline directly, or register selected pipelines with `defineProject`;
  compilation alone does not register children or any other pipelines. Export
  the project for CLI and Studio: Standard JSON Schema input metadata
  enables automatic commands; custom or schema-less inputs need explicit adapters
  in the project's entry list. Handler inputs and pipeline results are
  unknown; validate or narrow them. Plans still do not validate business inputs.
  Use `tubeless validate --json <document.yaml>` for a structure-only check
  without handlers. Fetch `https://tubeless.io/schemas/pipeline-document-v1.schema.json`
  for editor and agent validation, or use packaged `docs/pipeline-document.schema.json`.
  Optional metadata (`name`, `description`, `authors`, `date`) does not affect
  execution; compile and plan to check handler references and graph semantics.

- `fromPipeline` for an independently useful child workflow;
  `forEachPipeline` for runtime fan-out with stable keys and bounded concurrency
  (a positive finite integer; invalid static values are rejected when the step is
  created, and an invalid callback value fails the step before any child starts).
  Omit `fromPipeline.mapOptions` when the parent's validated options satisfy the
  child's input type; it forwards them unchanged through child validation. Fan-out
  still requires explicit per-item mapping. Keep `mapOptions` limited to child
  domain input. Supply child execution controls
  separately through `controls`, either as a typed value or a callback. A child's
  `dryRun: false` never disables a dry-running parent.
  Use ordinary helpers or `runConcurrent` for lightweight work without child
  lifecycle reporting. Use `runConcurrentPartial` from `tubeless/batch` for partial
  results: branch on `ok`, use `completedIndexes` for successful outputs (including
  `undefined`), and read `failure` only when `ok` is false. A rejection may itself
  be `undefined`. Both helpers stop admitting work after failure or cancellation,
  drain active workers, and preserve input-order results without cancelling
  siblings. Invalid concurrency throws rather than returning an execution outcome.
- `iteratePipeline` for bounded repeated child execution. Supply fresh `initialState`,
  `mapOptions`, a positive safe-integer `maxIterations`, and `transition` returning
  `{ kind: "next", state }` or `{ kind: "finish", result }`. State is read-only
  by contract; required dependencies feed initialization/mapping. Static child
  controls remain separate from domain input. Cancellation drains the active child;
  dry-run propagates. Plans show the bounded region, not future execution IDs.
  Read `docs/child-pipeline-composition.md` and `examples/iteration.ts`.
- `createSteps(optionsSchema)`, `outputSchema`, or `resultSchema` for runtime
  validation at untrusted boundaries. Reuse the project's Standard Schema
  implementation; core needs no schema dependency.
- `definePipelineCommand(pipeline)` from `tubeless/cli` for pipeline-backed scripts.
  Start with `examples/automatic-cli.ts`: Standard JSON Schema input metadata on
  the options schema supplies flags automatically. Use `overrides` only for names,
  aliases, descriptions or environment fallbacks. Explicit `params` replaces
  inference for type-only pipelines or custom CLI inputs; `mapOptions` is only
  needed when their shapes differ.
  Built-in `--step` / `--target` flags map to `stepIds` / `targets`. Do not
  redeclare built-in flags. `--resume` is available only with managed
  `checkpoint` configuration or an explicit `resume: true` command whose
  application code handles `values.resume`; unsupported commands reject it and
  omit it from Studio forms. Read `docs/cli.md` for option mapping.
  Export `defineProject(id, pipelines)` from `tubeless.project.ts` to expose
  schema-backed pipelines directly to the CLI and optional Studio. Use
  explicit adapters in the project's entry list for schema-less pipelines,
  even with no inputs: automatic project commands require Standard JSON Schema
  input metadata. Declare custom `params`, `mapOptions`, and display names on
  `definePipelineCommand`; each adapter uses its pipeline's ID. Project `cwd`
  controls CLI/Studio execution relative to the project file. Use `defineCommand`
  for standalone scripts. For compiled documents, create explicit adapters from
  `compiled.get(id)` and register them directly in the entry list.
  Default-export the project to select it for CLI and Studio. Without a default,
  exactly one distinct project may be exported; aliases are allowed.
- Run a schema-backed pipeline file directly with
  `tubeless run ./pipelines/import.ts -- --source rows.txt`. A marked
  `definePipelineCommand` export wins when present; otherwise the file must expose
  one unique pipeline whose Standard JSON Schema input metadata supports inferred
  flags. Use `--export` to select among multiple exports. Schema-less or unsupported
  input shapes still require an explicit command adapter.
- Use `pipelines/<name>.ts` for definitions. Add `scripts/<name>.ts` command
  wrappers only when explicit `params`, `mapOptions`, or presentation overrides
  are needed. Preserve existing consumer conventions.
- Keep storage and Studio optional. Read `docs/studio.md` before adding them;
  read the composition guides before adding child or remote execution.
- Use `context.recordArtifact({ operation, artifact })` within ordinary steps to
  record successful reads, writes, or verified reuse without changing domain outputs.
  Multiple reports support batches; earlier reports survive later failure. Keep
  checkpoint advancement and atomic promotion application-owned. `loadArtifact` and
  `saveArtifact` are conveniences for one read or unconditional write: both return
  `{ value, artifact }` and publish the typed value. Savers skip dry runs by default;
  loaders that populate caches also need a safe dry-run policy. Forward cancellation
  into adapters. Metadata must be bounded plain JSON with `id` or `uri`; omit secrets.
  See `docs/artifacts.md` and `examples/artifact-lineage.ts`.
- Use `tubeless/node` for cwd-relative path factories, JSON artifacts, required
  environment values and checkpoints. Call `definePaths` factories with
  `context.cwd`; keep `writeJson` and `resetDir` inside dry-run-safe steps.
  `readJson<T>` parses but does not validate untrusted data. See `docs/recipes.md`.
- For Node CPU parallelism, use `createWorkerThreadAdapter` from `tubeless/node`
  through `fromRemote` with an explicit module export and cloneable input.
  Keep output validation on the parent step. A shared adapter bounds worker threads;
  the pipeline still needs `maxConcurrency` to admit parallel steps. Call `close()`
  after all callers finish; cancellation can terminate unresponsive workers.
  See `examples/worker-threads.ts` and `docs/remote-step-composition.md`.
- Implement concrete JSON or telemetry adapters in the application against
  `PipelineTraceExporter`; adapt the package's `examples/tracing.ts`. Use
  `composeTraceExporters` for multiple trace destinations. Finished traces
  can be read with `tubeless history --trace` or `tubeless ui --trace`; recorded
  contents are not redacted.

## Verify

Typecheck the consumer and run focused tests. Use `createPipelineTestRuntime`
from `tubeless/testing` for deterministic observation and cancellation, with
fake I/O for side effects. Supply intermediate values with `overrideStep(step, value)`
and test-run `{ overrides: [...] }` controls. Overrides validate through `outputSchema`
and use normal lifecycle states and hooks with `outputSource: "override"` metadata,
including failed or cancelled validation attempts. Their normal, skip, dry-run, child,
and remote handlers never execute. Select overridden steps explicitly when using exact `stepIds`, and exclude
upstream steps to avoid their I/O. See `examples/step-output-overrides.ts` and
`docs/concepts.md` for selection and failure semantics. Check failure gates, skipped
outputs, and dry-run behavior. Generate diagrams with `pipeline.toMermaid()` when useful.

Within the Tubeless source repository, also follow its `AGENTS.md` and run
`make check`.
