# Contributing

Pull requests are accepted for now. Tubeless will stay a small-maintainer
project: a merged PR does not come with commit access, and I am not looking
for a large set of regular contributors.

If a change is large or touches the public API, open an issue first.

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3.14 or later
- Node.js 22.6 or later
- GNU Make

## Working on the package

```sh
make install
make check
```

`make check` is the same gate CI runs. It bootstraps the package, then uses the
[`scripts/check-pipeline.ts`](./scripts/check-pipeline.ts) command to run the
remaining checks as a concurrent Tubeless pipeline and record `logs/check.ndjson`.
`make help` lists the rest. `make install` runs `bun ci`.

### Fast loops

`make lint` never rebuilds; linting is syntactic. Tests and type checks resolve
`tubeless` from `dist/`, so they need a build after source changes — `make test`
and `make typecheck` run one for you. With `dist/` current, `make test-run` runs
only the vitest suite and `make typecheck-run` only the type checks.

`make watch` builds once, then recompiles `src/` on change while vitest re-runs
the suite; stop it with Ctrl-C. The generated Studio client bundle is the one
artifact `tsc` does not produce, so `make watch` leaves it at the last
`make build`: rerun `make build` after editing
`src/studio/run-store-ui-client*`, and `make studio-check` when the served client
looks stale.

Before changing usage or public behavior, read
[`docs/agent-guide.md`](./docs/agent-guide.md) and the repository-local
[`tubeless` skill](./skills/tubeless/SKILL.md). Do not edit
`docs/api-reference.md` or `docs/api-report.json` by hand; after an intentional
public-surface change, run `bun run api:generate`. Keep examples on public
package imports. Pull requests that change the report get a job summary of
added and removed entrypoints and symbols; `api:check` only proves the report
was regenerated.

### Website

The public site lives in [`website/`](./website/) and is not part of the npm
package. Local development:

```sh
cd website && bun ci && bun run dev
```

See [`website/README.md`](./website/README.md). `make check` does not build the
site; use `make website` or `make website-build` for that.
