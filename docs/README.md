# Tubeless documentation

Tubeless provides typed execution pipelines for data processing, application
workflows, and AI workloads. Start with a small pipeline, then choose the
controls and integrations your work needs. The guides link to examples you can
adapt in your project.

Use the recipe index to choose an implementation pattern. Use the generated
API inventory to check exported names and signatures.
